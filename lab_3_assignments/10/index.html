				<p class="post-title">CSS Fix for iOS vh-unit Bug</p>
				<p class="post-subtitle">Jul 29, 2015 • Tutorials → CSS, Responsive Design</p>
				<p class="post-body">There are many Javascript fixes for the viewport height units bug in iOS 7 (iPhone
					& iPad), this article will cover
					how to resolve this bug with CSS. This particular bug affects the rendering of viewport height
					units, for example:
					if you try to make a full viewport height container with height:100vh, it will display a very tall
					empty gap.
					Although this bug was fixed in iOS 8, but many old iPhone and iPad users are still using the old iOS
					7. The vh-unit
					buggyfill is one of the popular Javascript workarounds, but if you don't want to rely on Javascript
					here is a quick
					CSS fix using media queries.</p>

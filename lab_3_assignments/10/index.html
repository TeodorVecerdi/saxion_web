	CSS Fix for iOS vh-unit Bug

	Jul 29, 2015 • Tutorials → CSS, Responsive Design

	There are many Javascript fixes for the viewport height units bug in iOS 7 (iPhone & iPad), this article will cover how to resolve this bug with CSS. This particular bug affects the rendering of viewport height units, for example: if you try to make a full viewport height container with height:100vh, it will display a very tall empty gap. Although this bug was fixed in iOS 8, but many old iPhone and iPad users are still using the old iOS 7. The vh-unit buggyfill is one of the popular Javascript workarounds, but if you don't want to rely on Javascript here is a quick CSS fix using media queries.

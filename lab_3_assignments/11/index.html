					5 September 2016
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-text">On 6 September 1976, an aircraft appears out of the clouds near the Japanese city
					of Hakodate, on the
					northern
					island of Hokkaido. It’s a twin-engined jet, but not the kind of short-haul airliner Hakodate is
					used to seeing.
					This huge, grey hulk sports the red stars of the Soviet Union. No-one in the West has ever seen one
					before.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-text">The jet lands on Hakodate’s concrete-and-asphalt runway. The runway, it turns
					out, is not long
					enough. The jet
					ploughs through hundreds of feet of earth before it finally comes to rest at the far end of the
					airport.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-text">The pilot climbs out of the plane’s cockpit and fires two warning shots from his
					pistol – motorists
					on the road next
					to the airport have been taking pictures of this strange sight. It is some minutes before airport
					officials, driving
					from the terminal, reach him. It is then that the 29-year-old pilot, Flight Lieutenant Viktor
					Ivanovich Belenko of
					the Soviet Air Defence Forces, announces that he wishes to defect.
				</p>
				<p class="bottom-text">It is no normal defection. Belenko has not wandered into an embassy, or jumped
					ship while visiting a
					foreign port.
					The plane that he has flown 400-odd miles, and which now sits stranded at the end of a provincial
					Japanese runway,
					is the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25. It is the most secretive aircraft the Soviet Union has ever built.

			<p>In recent years, the 1980s-era philosophical discussions about artificial intelligence (AI)—whether computers can
				"really" think, refer, be conscious, and so on—have led to new conversations about how we should deal with the forms
				that many argue actually are implemented. These "AIs", if they achieve "Superintelligence" (Nick Bostrom), could
				pose "existential risks" that lead to "Our Final Hour" (Martin Rees). And Stephen Hawking recently made
				international headlines when he noted "The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the
				human race."</p>
			<p>THE EDGE QUESTION—2015</p>
			<p>WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MACHINES THAT THINK?</p>
			<p>But wait! Should we also ask what machines that think, or, "AIs", might be thinking about? Do they want, do they
				expect civil rights? Do they have feelings? What kind of government (for us) would an AI choose? What kind of
				society would they want to structure for themselves? Or is "their" society "our" society? Will we, and the AIs,
				include each other within our respective circles of empathy?</p>
			<p>Numerous Edgies have been at the forefront of the science behind the various flavors of AI, either in their research
				or writings. AI was front and center in conversations between charter members Pamela McCorduck (Machines Who Think)
				and Isaac Asimov (Machines That Think) at our initial meetings in 1980. And the conversation has continued unabated,
				as is evident in the recent Edge feature "The Myth of AI", a conversation with Jaron Lanier, that evoked rich and
				provocative commentaries.</p>
			<p>Is AI becoming increasingly real? Are we now in a new era of the "AIs"? To consider this issue, it's time to grow
				up. Enough already with the science fiction and the movies, Star Maker, Blade Runner, 2001, Her, The Matrix, "The
				Borg". Also, 80 years after Turing's invention of his Universal Machine, it's time to honor Turing, and other AI
				pioneers, by giving them a well-deserved rest. We know the history. (See George Dyson's 2004 Edge feature "Turing's
				Cathedral".) So, once again, this time with rigor, the Edge Question—2015:</p>
